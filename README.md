# UK-Road-Accident
## Road Accident for years 2021 and 2022 data analysis 

### Problem Statement

In this project, we have more than 300,000 road accidents in the UK.   

Our challenge is to analyze these accidents and find out the number of casualties according to :
- Accident severity
- Vehicle Type
- Road Type
- Road Surface
- Area/Location & Day/Night

The purpose is to reduce the number of accidents in the future

### Dataset Used

In this dashboard, data represents the number of casualties from 2021 to 2023, expressed in 307974 rows and 23 columns.   

### Analyses derived from the dataset
